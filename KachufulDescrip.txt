I’ve created my own version of the Kachuful game with customized rules. A maximum of 8 players can participate using a single deck, with a total of 10 rounds.

The game starts with each player receiving 1 card in the first round, 2 cards in the second round, and so on, until players receive 10 cards in the final round. It’s a turn-based game, played in a clockwise order, beginning with the game creator (admin).

Basic Rules:
Bidding Phase: At the start of each round, players bid one by one. This happens at the beginning of every round.

Card-Throwing Phase: After bidding, the player who bid first starts the card-throwing phase, and play continues clockwise. Players can only play one card per turn.

For example, in the second round, players have 2 cards, so there will be 2 turns (or hands) during the card-throwing phase. The player who bid first plays a card, followed by the others, until all cards are played.
Hand Winners: After each hand, a winner is declared, and the winner of the previous hand starts the next hand within the same round.

In the second round, this process repeats for both turns, and in subsequent rounds, for 3 cards, 4 cards, and so on.
Round Progression: After each round, the next round begins with the player next in line (clockwise) from the one who started the previous round.

Scoring: At the end of each round, scores for that round are displayed for all players.

Overall, the game runs smoothly!
